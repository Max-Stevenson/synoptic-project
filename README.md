# Synoptic Project - Membership System

## Installation
Clone repository and cd into project.

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the required modules for ***both*** `client` and `server`.

```bash
npm install
```

## Running
1. From within the `server` directory run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
2. From within the `client` directory run:
```bash
webpack-dev-server
```
3. Either navigate to <http://localhost:8080/> to experience the front-end client, or use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to make requests directly to the API.
Refer to the [API Guide](https://github.com/Max-Stevenson/synoptic-project/blob/master/API%20Guide.md) for further info.
